                    <head>THE JAPANESE FLEET.</head>
                    <p>Among the most interesting items of tele
                    graphic news that have arrived this morning,
                    is the information that the large majority
                    of the Russian men-of-war sunk at Port Arthur
                    are far less damaged than was anticipated,
                    and will be perfectly serviceable when raised.
                    The Peresvirat, the Bayan, and the Pallada
                    have already been floated. The Varyak and
                    Novik, victims of the combats of <placeName>Chemulpho</placeName>
                    and <placeName>Aniwa</placeName>, are also in Japanese hands,
                    and the "crowning mercy" of Tsusima gave
                    Admiral Togo four armoured ships to add
                    to his fleet and in some degree replace the
                    lost Hatsuse and Yashima. Meantime two
                    armoured cruisers of a type indistinguishable
                    from battleships have been laid down in Japan
                    and are progressing rapidly. Twenty-five tor
                    pedo boat destroyers, ten torpedo-boats, and
                    several submarines are on the stocks, and the
                    Katori and Kashima, vessels that can fairly
                    be compared with the King Edward VII., will
                    be delivered at the end of the war. Three
                    huge vessels of a new and superlatively power
                    ful type have also been ordered, and there is
                    no question that in a year's time no Pacific
                    squadron, except perhaps that of the United
                    States of America, will compare with the fleet
                    that will fly the Rising Sun.</p>
                    <p>England has had the good sense to recognise
                    the imminence of this change and to show her
                    complete confidence in her ally by removing
                    her ironclad squadron to European waters.
                    The seven battleships recalled from China are
                    to add to the strength of the European fleets
                    of Great Britain. Four of them will join the
                    Channel, late Home, Squadron, which will
                    soon number 15 battleships, while the other
                    three will increase the Atlantic Fleet, the
                    Mediterranean Fleet, and the commissioned
                    Reserve. In future the Eastern fleet will consist
                    of three groups of cruisers and be based on
                    Hong Kong, Aden, and Sydney.</p>
                    <p>The action of the British Government clearly
                    shows that the prophecies of certain publicists,
                    that Japan would be embroiled after the war
                    with the English-speaking Powers, are not
                    likely to be fulfilled in our own case. England
                    hands over the control of the China Seas to
                    her ally-that is all. As to the relations of
                    other Powers with the new mistress of the
                    Pacific, we greatly doubt whether any of the
                    Continental States will dream of attempting to
                    compete with Japan in Eastern waters, or of
                    impeding Japan's action in China. As for
                    America, the two countries are at present on
                    friendly terms, but we wonder how soon the
                    Japanese will resent the threatened exclusion
                    of their compatriots from California, Hawaii,
                    and the Philippines. There is the danger
                    point,-if the Australian and American de
                    mocracies insist on excluding Japanese
                    immigrants or throwing restrictions on their
                    immigration which are not applied to the
                    majority of the low-class Europeans who go
                    to the Commonwealth or the Republic, they
                    may some day have to face the yellow world
                    armed, [illegible]kless and terrible. If, on the contrary,
                    they decide on a liberal policy restricting
                    only the immigration of the ignorant, the
                    diseased, and the criminal, and abandon that
                    colour-prejudice which is such an amazing
                    feature in the most advanced modern demo
                    cracies, the peace of the Pacific is assured
                    for half a century to come.</p>

                        with the sole object of assisting British trade
                        in this country. The services of the Chamber
                        are always at the disposal of any member
                        desiring information on trade matters generally,
                        including the question of appointing suitable
                        agents. As no fee is charged for such advice,
                        it is obviously in the interests of all British
                        traders here to become members, especially
                        when it is remembered that the annual sub

                        <p>NEW SYSTEM OF ARTESIAN WELL.- <persName>Mr. G.
                            N. Perrakis</persName> of Alexandria has invented a new
                        system of artesian well superior to any other
                        system, owing to its perfection and power of
                        resistance, being constructed with the best
                        material and capable of increasing instead of
                        decreasing the supply of water. One of the
                        kind was constructed on the estate of Messrs
                        N. and A. Sursock, and has been patented to
                        avoid imitations. Mr. Perrakis has procured
                        special tools for boring and digging earth of
                        any kind, above 2,000 feet. For hitherto
                        uncultivated lands he accepts the value of the
                        work in land. He has a stock of steam engines,
                        mills, ice-making machines, aerated water plant,

                        <p>The statutory meeting of the Egyptian
                        Estates, Limited, was held yesterday week at

                        of the company) presiding.</p>
                        <p>The Secretary (Mr. Sydney William Bart
                        man) having read the notice calling the
                        meeting,</p>
                        <p>The Chairman said: This is, as you are
                        aware, the statutory general meeting, and
                        you have in your hands the accounts up to
                        April 20th which the Act of Parliament says
                        we must present to you. I have really very
                        little to say. These statutory meetings have
                        been provided by the Acts of Parliament,
                        and all sorts of conditions have been made
                        as to what we are to tell you. I suppose
                        they are devised for the protection of share-
                        holders, but, personally, I do not see how a
                        meeting held under these circumstances can
                        be much protection. The accounts before you
                        are made up to April 30th-a date when
                        the company was in an embryo state, when
                        even the payments on allotment were not
                        complete, and when we had not commenced
                        the investment of even the small portion of
                        funds we had in our hands at that time. I sup
                        pose, at any rate, it gives one an opportunity of
                        seeing the shareholders and having a talk to
                        them, and I wish there were more present,
                        but those who are not present will have
                        the opportunity of reading what I have
                        said. You know there were a good many
                        companies of this kind started much about
                        the same time as we did, and many of
                        the chairmen of these companies have thought
                        fit to indulge in rather extravagant prophecies
                        as to the future of their companies, but this is
                        a course which I do not propose to take. I
                        am rather of the opinion of the American
                        writer who said "Never prophesy unless you
                        know." I do not know anything about the
                        future of this company, but what I do know is
                        that the capital of the company was more than
                        fully subscribed by responsible people and our
                        preliminary expenses were ridiculously small,
                        that no promotion money was paid, and that
                        therefore the whole of the capital of the com
                        pany, with trifling reductions, is available for
                        the purpose of the business. In order to
                        obtain that business we have taken the trouble
                        to get the very best advice we possible can.
                        You will, of course, not expect me to go into
                        the details of the business, but I will say
                        that so far the funds of the company have
                        been employed in a very admirable manner.
                        <persName>Mr. Lang Anderson</persName>, who is one of our prin
                        ciple advisers in Egypt, is a gentleman who is
                        a very successful worker in all matters connect
                        ed with land investment in Egypt, and we rely
                        very much on his advice. We are all
                        striving to work together to obtain the best
                        results possible for the shareholders. The
                        principle we have laid down is that no ivest
                        ment of a large sum should be made without
                        our being consulted on this side, and so far as
                        we have gone there has not been any conflict
                        of opinion as to the desirability of any of the
                        transactions into which we have entered.
                        If we continue to work together as harmoni
                        ously in future as we have hitherto the results
                        cannot fail to be satisfactory to you. I have
                        been told, with what truth I do not know,
                        that we have been blamed in some quarter in
                        Egypt-not on this side-for keeping the
                        control too much in our own hands, and we
                        have been told that we may lose opportunities
                        of picking up advantageous bargains because
                        time would be lost in communicating with
                        London. If that is so, I cannot help it.
                        Directors year by year have more and more
                        responsibilities thrown upon them by Act of
                        Parliament, and we are bound to protect our
                        selves, and in so doing protect you. If your
                        interests suffer from excess of caution you
                        will at any rate not be able to blame us in
                        that respect. Our policy has been deliberately
                        adopted, and we are not inclined to alter it at
                        present, at all events until we see how we are
                        getting on. I may be expected, perhaps, to
                        give you some idea of the nature of our
                        business. The investment of capital in Egypt
                        is mainly connected with agricultural land,
                        and since the British occupation a wave of
                        prosperity has set in, and I see no reason to
                        doubt it will continue. The native population
                        are realising that life and property are now
                        secure, and the hoarding of money, which
                        was so prevalent in the days of former
                        Khedives is being discontinued. Money is
                        being brought out for the improvement and
                        development of the country, and the natives
                        themselves enter very largely into compe
                        tition in the real estate market. This gives facili
                        ty, and will give facility for some time to come,
                        for the profitable employment of capital in all
                        matters connected with land and agriculture.
                        By this I do not mean gambling in real estate,
                        but it will doubtless often be possible to pick
                        up bargains in land and property with a view
                        to reselling. This, however, I trust, will be
                        the exception. Our idea is to employ our
                        money in loans and mortgages and enterprises
                        that will be bringing in immediate returns, and
                        not to lock it up for years in land speculation.
                        That is the general trend of our business and
                        beyond that I am not prepared to go into
                        further details, though if there are questions
                        which any shareholder wishes to ask I shall
                        be pleased to answer. I now move the adoption

                            a well-known Alexandrian land-owner is about
                            to propose to the Government an undertaking
                            that will add about a million square metres to
                            the amount of land available for building at
                            Alexandria. The idea of filling up a large part
                            of the shallow <placeName>Anfouchy Bay</placeName> and a small
                            section of the Eastern harbour, and using
                            the land thus reclaimed from the sea for
                            building purposes, is most suggestive, and
                            should the proposal be entertained by the

                            imagine that rents, which are just now ridicul

                            proportions-if the Government only exercises

                        <p>July is as a rule a criminal month in our
                        province, for the <persName>fellah</persName> has little work to do,
                        and is, in consequence, on the alert to avenge
                        the misdeeds of others or to commit fresh
                        crimes himself. I understand that eight crimes
                        took place last week in the Tahta district, of
                        which the following was certainly the most
                        curious.</p>
                        <p>Two sheikhs were teaching some religious
                        subject in a mosque at <placeName>Tema</placeName>. They had many
                        hearers. After a while they disputed over the
                        proper interpretation of a passage, had a sharp
                        quarrel, and were only calmed by the efforts of
                        their audience. But this calm was not of long
                        duration, for one of the sheikhs went to his
                        house and returned with a revolver with which
                        he shot his rival as he passed him in the street.
                        The wound was fortunately not mortal and one
                        of the sheikhs is now in gaol, while the other
                        remains in hospital.</p>
                        <p>On Sunday night the two brothers of a
                        woman who had been three years a widow fell
                        upon her and strangled her in their house at
                        El Tawader village in the Baliana Markaz. It
                        appears that she had a suitor, who was not "a
                        Hawary" i.e., of pure Arab descent, being
                        but a mere fellah. Her brothers refused his
                        affinity and having suspicions concerning
                        the relations of their sister with her suitor
                        trangled <!-- original typo --> her in the night. Both have been
                        arrested.</p>

                            <p>The "Neue Preussiche Kreuz Zeitung" is
                            by no means pleased with the tone of the
                            questions asked in Parliament re the formation
                            of a German steamer service on the Nile. Our
                            contemporary writes:-Wherever German
                            trade and German shipping appear in the
                            world's market they are assailed and persecuted
                            by the English. The news that a German S.S.
                            Company was about to start a Nile service
                            drove <persName>Lord Muskerry</persName> to ask the Government if
                            the report was really true. It almost seems
                            that the people in England regard Egypt as an
                            integral part of the British Empire, though the
                            country is in reality a tributary State of the
                            Ottoman Empire. It was emphatically stated
                            in that much quoted Anglo-French Agreement
                            of April 8, 1904, that, as in Morocco, no
                            political changes should be made in Egypt.
                            The annexation of Egypt by England is
                            therefore forbidden. The Capitulations remain
                            in force and the "most-favored nation"
                            clause operates in the country's commercial
                            relations. On account of this clause no
                            opposition can be made to the appearance
                            of a German shipping company on the scene
                            and to its starting a river service on the Nile,
                            however bitterly the English may discuss the
                            matter.</p>

                            a boat unloaded in this way near the Serai
                            Sofia, about theree minutes' walk from the
                            tram terminus at Moharrem Bey. A whole
                            cargo of earth was landed, which produced an
                            immense amount of dust, almost blinding the
                            passers-by and annoying residents of houses
                            in the locality. Some of the house-owners of
                            the neighborhood complained at the caracol
                            at Moharrem Bey, but in spite of the orders of
                            the moawen nothing was done to prevent this
                            breach of the regulations. The policemen start
                            ed on his errand but did nothing. Naturally
                            the boatmen were encouraged by their freedom

                        <p>Confirming my telegram of this morning, I
                        learn that the battleship Vengeance, one of 
                        the four which have been here since Sunday
                        night, has something seriously wrong with her
                        machinery, which defect made it necessary for
                        the Albion to tow her a considerable distance
                        in the Malacca Straits. She is to leave at
                        2 p.m. in company with the Ocean, Cen
                        turion, and Albion, and arrangements have
                        been made by the Ocean to tow her as far
                        as Malta, where necessary repairs will be
                        effected.</p>

                        <p>The death of Captain Leitgeb, the much
                        respected agent of the Austrian Lloyd here,
                        has plunged the town in mourning. All flags
                        were half-mast yesterday and but little was
                        talked of beyond the death of this gentleman.
                        Capt. LEitgeb served some 15 years at sea in
                        the Austrian Lloyd vessels, and has represented
                        his company here for many years.</p>

                        <p>The Holt Line S.S. Calchas, which came
                        out of the Canal at 10 a.m. to-day, is now on
                        her first homeward voyage after her capture,
                        some five months ago, by the Russians. It
                        appears that she was nearing the end of her
                        voyage outwards, her destination being <placeName>Yoko
                        hama</placeName>, and had a certain quantity of cotton
                        and mails on board, both of which had been
                        declared absolute contraband. The vessel,m
                        with the same captain on board as now com
                        mands the ship, was taken to Vladivostock and
                        there guarded with a prize crew over four
                        months in practically the depth of winter.
                        Her entire crew were kept by her under a
                        Russian guard, which treated them in many
                        ways by no means well. The cold was intense,
                        but none of the ship's people appear to have
                        suffered or to have been any the worse for
                        their long stay. The Court at Vladivostok
                        decided that the vessel was a legal prize and
                        intended confiscating her, but eventually
                        merely removed all her contraband and allow
                        ed her to proceed to China, from which coun
                        try she brings the first of the season's teas.
                        She will leave at 4 p.m.</p>

                        <head>ARRIVAL OF SALVAGE VESSEL.</head>
                        <p>On the 15th inst., a tug-boat called the
                        Flamant, towing the Champenois, a 300-ton
                        lighter, caused some little surprise by coming
                        in from sea and anchoring in the port. It
                        was at first supposed that the lighter was
                        towed here for ordinary commercial purposes,
                        but I learn now that the Flamant and her
                        consort are here as the result of consider
                        able thought on the part of a private firm,
                        and that they are intended for salvage work.
                        It will surprise many to learn that not a 
                        single properly equipped salvage vessel is
                        owned by the Canal Company and that in
                        almost every case of need of late years,
                        outside aid has been required to salve badly
                        damaged ships, ignoring the cases of ships
                        merely aground.</p>

                        <p>The sharp break in South Africans and the
                        general weakness at the end of last week have
                        been followed by an almost equally quick
                        reaction. The settlement, which concluded
                        yesterday, having gone through practically
                        without a hitch, has helped largely to restore
                        confidence to markets, as well as a report in
                        Paris that a very strong combination is being
                        formed by the greater groups, Messrs. Wernher,
                        Beit, Eckstein, L. Hirsch &amp; Co., Neumann,
                        and the Central Mining Trust, with a
                        view to defeating the market tactics of the
                        Barnato group, and also with the possible end
                        in view of buying up the Barnato interests,
                        who, it is beliefved, would not be altogether
                        averse to withdrawing from Citiy finance at the
                        present juncture.</p>
                        <p>The appointment of <persName>M. Witte</persName> as the Russian
                        representative at Washington is taken as a 
                        marked step in the direction of peace, negotia
                        tions for which look like being commenced
                        next month in earnest. The success of the new
                        Japanese 4 1/2% loan, taken in conjunction with
                        the admitted failure to raise a small internal
                        loan in Russia, must also help towards an early
                        conclusion of the war.</p>
                        <p>The gilt-edged market is a decidedly good
                        one, and the present moment should offer good
                        opportunities to the genuine investor. Public
                        interest in the mining section is far too small
                        yet for any marked improvement to be pro
                        bable. The market is too much in the hands of
                        outside manipulators, and, in addition to this,
                        many dealers have had to be helped of late,
                        which must constitute a certain source of
                        weakness.</p>
                        <p>There has been a rally in the Egyptian min
                        ing section this week, where some well-informed
                        buying has been seen. Nile Valleys certainly
                        look a tempting lock-up at 1 1/8, and United
                        Africans at 1 5/16. A feature yesterday was
                        the rise in Egyptian Mines to 15s. Land Bank
                        shares are steady. Agricultural Banks keep
                        very firm at 13 7/8 on the issue of 243,000 new
                        shares to the present holders share for share
                        at par-£5-which constiutes a very hand
                        some bonus. Nationals are steady at 26 3/8,

                        <p><hi rend="italic">American Futures</hi>. The Market this week
                        has been exceedingly active, and prices have
                        been subject to frequent and violent fluc
                        tuations. To-day's closing values are 27 to 30
                        points below the highest rates touched. The
                        extreme advance was due to renewed bad
                        weather conditions, and heavy manipulation,
                        chiefly in the American markets, but also
                        to some extent here; the subsequent decline,
                        to improved weather report, to heavy reali
                        sations, and to the growing impression that
                        the disastrous state of the crop has been
                        much exaggerated. The trade here, and in
                        America, has been seriously and adversely
                        affected by the suddenness and magnitude
                        of the late advance, and spinners are now
                        purchasing their minimum requirements. We
                        cannot venture any opinion. All the markets
                        are in a feverish and dangerous state, and
                        it will evidently require regular and favora
                        ble weather conditions to hold speculation in
                        check.</p>
