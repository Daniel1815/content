                        <p>What <persName>Lord Roberts</persName> has to say on the sub
                        ject of Imperial Defence will always be listen
                        ed to with respect by those interested in
                        the services; but we doubt if his lordship's
                        words in the <orgName>House of Lords</orgName> las week will
                        be paid any attention to by the public gene
                        rally. At home the Army is looked upon as
                        something quite outside the national life:
                        the public are not interested in its welfare,
                        because they have never been educated up
                        to it, nor been taken into the confidence of
                        the Government in regard to the real problem
                        of national defence. The members of both
                        Houses of Parliament are equally indifferent.
                        With the exception of the efforts made by
                        <persName>Mr. Balfour</persName> a short time back, no Minister
                        has ever taken the trouble to explain to
                        the public his view of what our military
                        requirements are at home and abroad. The
                        majority of the British public are at this
                        moment in absolute ignorance as to what our
                        participation in a Continental war would in
                        volve from a military point of view.</p>
                        <p>There has been a good deal of tinkering
                        with the Army and auxiliary forces since the
                        South African war, but you will not get a
                        single intelligent individual to admit that we
                        are any nearer at this moment to a solution of
                        the recruiting difficulty than we were before
                        the war. There is some reason to believe that
                        not more than 50 per cent. of the regular
                        Army at home are fitted to go abroad in the
                        event of a war, and it is calculated that it
                        would take the whole of the Army Reserve to
                        make up the deficiency. Lord Roberts has
                        spoken plainly enough, but his lordship was
                        himself associated with the organisation of
                        the military forces of this country for
                        some time after the South African war
                        But he did nothing. He subjected him-</p>

                        <p>self entirely to the will of an untried
                        civilian War Minister in <persName>Mr. Brodrick</persName>. The
                        Army Council have now been some time in
                        office, but although it is perfectly well-known
                        that they are not in agreement with Mr.
                        <persName>Arnold Forster</persName> and his amateur efforts, they
                        have not the spirit to protest. They are entire
                        ly in his hands. What is the result? We
                        have it on the authority of the most distin
                        guished soldier in the country that "our armed
                        forces, as a body, are as absolutely unfitted
                        and unprepared for war as they were in 1899-
                        1900." These were Lord Roberts' words in the
                        House of Lords. Are we going on like this
                        for ever, or is there any hope of a statesman
                        being forthcoming with the ability to grapple
                        with the military problem? It is a very serious
                        matter, but we are afraid that nothing short
                        of disaster will ever make the British public
                        realise it, and when war comes we have to
                        remember that failure in one part of the
                        Empire involves trouble, and perhaps very
                        grave and serious trouble, in other areas. A
                        defeat near our frontiers in Afghanistan or
                        Persia might entail, among its unpleasant conse
                        quences, a rising in S.Africa, or the appearance
                        of an alarming number of Mahdis and Mullahs
                        in our African possesions.</p>
                        <p>The war on two fronts, Bismarck's and
                        Germany's nightmare will be our portion if we
                        fail in the opening stages of any great land
                        struggle of the future, and the British Empire
                        fronts in so many directions that we should be
                        lucky to get off with a struggle or two only. A
                        disastrous naval battle is not the only possible
                        death-blow of the Empire. In a death struggle
                        with any powerful antagonist, wounds, that
                        would otherwise seem light, must tell. What
                        would have been our fate had the <persName>Amir
                        Abderrahman's</persName> death during the Boer War
                        been followed by a Russian advance into
                        Afghanistan? We are accustomed to bear much
                        of the warlike qualities of the Afghans, but we
                        heard the same of the Hunhuses before the
                        Russo-Japanese War, and these guerillas, who
                        fought for the Russians often enough, have
                        exercised ridiculously little influence on the
                        progress of the campaign, and in any case
                        there is much to be said for the policy of
                        relying on ourselves alone.</p>

                        <head>M. DELCASSE ON THE ENTENTE.</head>
                        <p>The "Gaulois" prints an account of an inter
                        view with <persName>M. Delcassé</persName> in which the ex-Minister,
                        asked regarding the exchange of visits between
                        the French and British fleets, is represented as
                        defending the following words the policy
                        that was his during his term of office:-</p>
                        <p>"A serious and effective policy is not
                        actuated by feelings of antipathy or sympathy
                        but interest. Which is our best customer at
                        the present time, Germany or England? Great
                        Britain. We sell her hundreds of millions
                        worth per annum. What does Germany buy
                        from us? Nothing almost. But she sells us
                        everything she can.</p>
                        <p>"But supposing we raise the discussion to
                        a somewhat higher plane, is it to be thought
                        that we can fight England if we leave irritating
                        questions open between her and ourselves?
                        For one ship that we build she puts three,
                        four, or five on the stocks. It is better then to
                        bow to cold reason and calculate what British
                        power can avail us in certain eventualities at
                        the cost of some apparent, not real, sacrifices
                        on our part. What such support can do for us
                        is to make it practically impossible for Ger
                        many to declare war on us."</p>
                        <p>"Then," said the reporter, "all the threats
                        of war since the outset of the Morocco incident
                        did not seem serious to you?"</p>
                        <p>"Not at all. What would Germany's grow
                        ing fleet do in a case of a war, in which Great
                        Britain would assuredly be with us against
                        Germany? What would happen to her com
                        mercial ports, to her merchant marine? It
                        would be annihilated. That is the meaning
                        of the visit, thought out and planned, of the
                        British squadron to <placeName>Brest</placeName>, and the visit sub
                        sequently to be paid by a French squadron to
                        <placeName>Spithead</placeName> will complete the demonstration.</p>
                        <p>Then, becoming more animated, M. Delcassé
                        exclaimed, "Has Morocco ever concerned Ger
                        many? Has Germany ever concerned Morocco?
                        Is it not the natural continuation of our North
                        African Empire?</p>
                        <p>"Yes, sir, mark this well. The entente cor
                        diale was a step forward towards the detente of
                        differences between Russia and Great Britain,
                        a detente of which the French Foreign Minister
                        was able and will always be able to contrive."</p>
                        <p>M. Delcassé, moreover, the "Gaulois" con
                        tinues, was not afraid of war. He thought we
                        ought to know how to use the Anglo-German
                        conflict to our advantage. In the eventuality
                        of a conflict with Germany, he told the Council
                        of Ministers at which he resigned, we were
                        in a position to reply to our neighbour's
                        attack.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, M. Delcassé, referring to the
                        acceptance of a conference by France, declared
                        that to go to the conference was a mistake,
                        and a very great one.</p>

                            that the Emperor received <persName>Admiral Rodjest
                            vensky's</persName> report on the 10th of July. The
                            Admiral ascribes the defeat to the defect in
                            guns, ammunition and ships due to administ
                            rative corruption, and also to mutinous and
                            incompetent crews. A mutiny broke out at
                            Madacascar, and again off Formosa, and
                            finally during the battle, when the crews of the
                            Seniavin and Apraxin refused to fight, and
                            part of the other crews followed their example.</p>

                        companies in Cairo as well as at Somerset
                        House is necessary. Egypt is quite inde

                        pany laws, which are, however, simple and
                        efficient. The recent tendendcy to buy Egyptian
                        shares, especially in the mining section, should
                        expand, and the withdrawal of carry-over
                        facilities will, by shaking out a few stale
                        accounts, render the position of the market
                        more healthy. By October great activity is
                        expected in all Egyptian financial concerns,

                        <p>BRITISH CHAMBER OF COMMERCE.-We would
                        draw the attention of manufacturers and mer
                        chants to the work of the British Chamber of
                        Commerce of Egypt, which was formed in 1896
                        with the sole object of assisting British trade
                        in this country. The services of the Chamber
                        are always at the disposal of any member
                        desiring information on trade matters generally,
                        including the question of appointing suitable
                        agents. As no fee is charged for such advice,
                        it is obviously in the interests of all British
                        traders here to become members, especially
                        when it is remembered that the annual sub
                        scription is merely the nominal one of £1. The
                        latter payment also includes a copy of the
                        monthly Journal issued by the Chamber. Home

                    Baronies of Ashburton and Revelstoke. The
                    oldest of these titles is the Barony of Ash

                    <head type="sub">RECLAMATION FOR BUILDING PURPOSES.</head>
                    <p>Ever since the question of the rise of house
                    rents was first raised, some two or three years
                    ago, the population of Alexandria has rapidly
                    and steadily increased. Pari passu there has
                    been an increase in the amount of speculation
                    both in house property and in the waste lands
                    that surround the town. Several companies in
                    the form of banks have been created for the
                    purpose, and the Municipality has acquired
                    very large areas belonging to the Government.
                    Previously the Government was always ready
                    to sell off these areas by sections to indivi
                    duals, but their occupation by the Municipality
                    has prevented their sale, while speculation has
                    so increased the price of land that, in spite of
                    the abundance of building sites and of areas
                    that have not been taken up, but are mono
                    polised by syndicates (of which the Munici
                    pality is involuntarily the chief), rents are
                    steadily rising and the working classes are
                    feeling the pinch.</p>
                    <p>We have frequently maintained that if the
                    Municipality is to help the public effectively,
                    it can only do so by selling the "terrains libres
                    appartenant à l'Etat" which are at its disposal
                    or by letting the Government continue to sell
                    them as before.</p>
                    <p>But if, for reasons which we cannot at
                    present discuss, all the land concessions to the
                    Municipality cannot be resumed by the Go
                    vernment, there remain certain areas where
                    some relief for the prevailing pressure and
                    over-crowding may be found. We mentioned
                    yesterday that a project for the utilisation of
                    Anfouchy bay was under consideration, and
                    we are now assured that a company which is
                    being formed will ask the Government for a
                    concession, not of any areas already enclosed,
                    which possess a considerable value thanks to
                    the artificial rise of prices, but of the shallowest
                    parts of the bay where the sea cannot be and
                    never has been utilised.</p>
                    <p>We hear that the company proposes to fill
                    up and reclaim the shallows in (1) the old port
                    between the Arsenal and Ras el-Tin Palace
                    (2) the whole of ANfouchy Bay for an area
                    one kilometre in length by from 600 to 800
                    metres in breadth; (3) the east port along a
                    shallow strip of one kilometre in length
                    situated between Kait Bey and the Gouvernorat.</p>
                    <p>Useless for the present and the future, if
                    left as they are, these areas are thoroughly
                    sheltered and, owing to their level character,
                    should one day give us the best quarters in
                    Alexandria. The old port might be used for
                    Government buildings, Anfouchy Bay for work
                    men's houses, and the East port for small flats,
                    etc., and while the look of the town would be
                    improved, the supply of new quarters would
                    greatly diminish the present overcrowding. At
                    present we hear so much of building at the
                    other end of Ramleh, on the western side of
                    Mex, on the south side of the Mahmoudieh
                    Canal, and by the Mariout lake, that we think
                    it necessary to call the attention of our fello
                    townsmen to the fact that it is perhaps,
                    hardly necessary to go so far afield for build
                    ing sites. Mex and Ramleh will always be
                    popular for climatic or social reasons with the
                    wealthier class of tenants, but a new work
                    men's quarter ought to be as near as possible
                    to the centre of town, pace the eloquent
                    but unconvincing advocates of garden cities.</p>
